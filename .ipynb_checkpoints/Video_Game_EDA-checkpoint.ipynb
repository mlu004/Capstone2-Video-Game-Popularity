    "# Exploratory Data Analysis of Video Game Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore the data through visualization, fill any missing values and look into feature that we hypothesised may have corrilation with our game popularity as well as explore what we will define as a \"popular\" video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a synopsis of what we learned in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hours of Game play: between 16 and 50 hours\n",
    "The merging of data sets Steam Purchase and Steam Play in part III, shows us that extermely long games have low sales, we determined this cut off was about 50 hours of game play.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part V, we saw that longer games did have a higher percentage of positive reviews, we determined that games above 16 hours were at least 50% positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can conclude keeping the game play between 16 and 50 hours will be a safe area\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular Genres: Action, Role-Playing, Shooting, Racing, Sports, Platform\n",
    "In part IV: We trimmed the data to look at only the most popular games by sales and then compared the User and critic scores to the sales with the hue set to Genre, Rating, and then Platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Action - Both User and Critic Scores appear fairly high for these games. Action is a solid choice for Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "Role-Playing - The User and Critic Scores appear to agree, though slightly lower sales than Action, still a solid option\n",
    "\n",
    "Shooting - It looks as if Critics like this genre more than users, sales are slightly higher than RP games, but lower than the potential of the Action games\n",
    "\n",
    "Racing - User and Critics seem to agree on the scores, they are less popular than Action (as far as scores), but have a higher potential for sales. We could hypothesise that this is because Racing games tend to have more co-op options, thus the need for players to have friends who play the game so they can play together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sports - Just like Shooting, Critics like these games more than users, and a suprisingly high sales similar to Racing. Do these games tend to have co-op options? \n",
    "\n",
    "Platform - There doesn't seem to be many of these in the popular games, however those that are here are scored high and have a decent number of sales. This sounds like a High Risk/High Reward genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular Platform: Current or up-to-date Systems\n",
    "It doesn't appear as if the critics have a prefrence in Platform, where as it looks like the Useres like the PSP, PS2, and 3DS and appear to dislike the XBox 360 and PS3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rating: Everyone, Teen, Mature\n",
    "Looking at the Ratings, it appears that making a game with a rating of Everyone or Teen is mroe popular amongs Users and Critics, with Everyone having a higher sales potentions, likely because the rating allows them to reach a younger audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that having a Mature rating has higher sales than Teen ratings, however it has the risk of lower user and critic scores."

    "To understand what we are about to do, you need to understand what we are looking at. We have 371 tags for the games, and value with each tag is how many users have tagged the game with that particular tag. The problem is, some tags are incorrect. In the previous notebook if you look at the heads of the data we see appid = 30 \"Day of Defeat\" has 5 tags for WW1 and 122 tags for WW2, a quick internet search tells us this is actually a WW2 game not WW1. My goal will be to create a threshold value that will allow us to decide if a tag is \"correct\" or not. We can change this value to meet our own prefrence, for now I will choose the threshold to be 75% of the max value."
